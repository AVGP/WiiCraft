How to use these Server files

Windows: 
Just execute the LaunchMinecraft.exe file
Linux/OSX:
Fire up a Command Line and cd into the server dir. Now execute the following Command Line: java -Xmx1024M -jar server.dat

Note:
Monsters, Animals and NPC's are Disabled by default
Online Mode is set to false, since WiiCraft does not contain any Authentification System.
